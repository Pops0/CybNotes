Select each of the following tools to learn more about how they can be used to perform software and protocol robustness tests, including fuzzers and code analysis tools.

**SpotBugs, Findsecbugs, and SonarQube**
	- _SpotBugs_ (previously known as Findbugs) is a static analysis tool designed to find bugs in applications created in the Java programming language. You can download and obtain more information about SpotBugs at [_https://spotbugs.github.io_](https://spotbugs.github.io/).
	- _Findsecbugs_ is another tool designed to find bugs in applications created in the Java programming language. It can be used with continuous integration systems such as Jenkins and SonarQube. Findsecbugs provides support for popular Java frameworks, including Spring-MCV, Apache Struts, and Tapestry. You can download and obtain more information about Findbugs at [_https://find-sec-bugs.github.io_](https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/).
	- _SonarQube_ is a tool that can be used to find vulnerabilities in code, and it provides support for continuous integration and DevOps environments. You can obtain additional information about SonarQube at [_https://www.sonarqube.org_](https://www.sonarqube.org/).

**Fuzzers and Fuzz Testing**
	_Fuzz testing_, or _fuzzing_ , is a technique that can be used to find software errors (or bugs) and security vulnerabilities in applications, operating systems, infrastructure devices, IoT devices, and other computing device. Fuzzing involves sending random data to the unit being tested in order to find input validation issues, program failures, buffer overflows, and other flaws. Tools that are used to perform fuzzing are referred to as _fuzzers_. Examples of popular fuzzers are Peach, Mutiny Fuzzing Framework, and American Fuzzy Lop.

**Peach**
	Peach is one of the most popular fuzzers in the industry. There is a free (open-source) version, the Peach Fuzzer Community Edition, and a commercial version. You can download the Peach Fuzzer Community Edition and obtain additional information about the commercial version at [_https://sourceforge.net/projects/peachfuzz/files/Peach/_](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peachfuzz/files/Peach/)

**Mutiny Fuzzing Framework**
	The Mutiny Fuzzing Framework is an open-source fuzzer created by Cisco. It works by replaying packet capture files (pcaps) through a mutational fuzzer. You can download and obtain more information about Mutiny Fuzzing Framework at [_https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/mutiny-fuzzer_](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/mutiny-fuzzer).
	
	**NOTE** The Mutiny Fuzzing Framework uses Radamsa to perform mutations. Radamsa is a tool that can be used to generate test cases for fuzzers. You can download and obtain additional information about Radamsa at [_https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa_](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa).

**American Fuzzy Lop**
	American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) is a tool that provides features of compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically improve the functional coverage of fuzzing test cases. You can obtain information about AFL from [_https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/_](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).
